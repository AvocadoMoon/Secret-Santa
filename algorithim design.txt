Have a set of answers be related to positive number scale, and the other set of questions be related to negative number scale. An
example would be for the question "Meaningful or Suprise" for gift, meaningful would be positive 1 and Suprise would be negative

number value.

After each question is assigned a value, the numbers are summed together for a final score. Individuals with similar scores mean that the majority of their answers must be aligned with anothers.

Once everyones score has been computed, get the four closest people to someone and connect them to that person.

Finally make every edge equal to 1 and compute max flow on the graph.
